# takeHome
This was a take home test for a startup company that I submitted, not naming the company here cuz they might still be recruitting ppl using this test, I did'nt make the cut wish I knew what the flaws were but just leaving this here for any other recruiter, this project required the usage of reddit API to display newest, top, and all redit posts
